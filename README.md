The ability to remember and recall information is a fundamental cognitive skill that plays a crucial role in our daily lives. 
As technology continues to shape our world, it presents opportunities to harness the power of programming and create 
interactive experiences that both entertain and challenge our mental faculties. This report presents a memory game 
project developed using the Java programming language, aimed at testing and improving players' memory skills 
while providing an engaging gaming experience. 
The development process involved various key components, including user interface design, card shuffling
,game logic, and score tracking. The graphical user interface (GUI) was carefully designed using Java's 
Swing library to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. The cards were shuffled using 
efficient algorithms to ensure that each game presents a unique arrangement, maximizing the challenge for 
players and preventing predictability
Functionalities 
 
1.Card Grid Generation and Display: The project should generate a grid of cards, each displaying a unique image.
The cards should be arranged randomly using shuffling algorithms to ensure a different layout for each game. 
 
2.User Interface Design: The project should incorporate a visually appealing and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). 
The GUI should provide clear instructions, display the card grid, and include interactive elements such as buttons for flipping cards. 
 
 
3.Card Flipping and Matching: The project should allow players to flip cards by clicking on them. When two cards are 
flipped, the game logic should check if they match. If they do, the cards should remain face up; otherwise, they should be flipped back. 
 
4.Difficulty Levels: The project should provide adjustable difficulty levels, allowing players to choose the number of 
cards in the grid. This functionality ensures that players of different skill levels can enjoy the game and tailor the challenge to their abilities. 
 
5.Game Completion and Replay: Once all the cards are successfully matched, the project should indicate the completion of 
the game and provide an option to replay the game with a new card arrangement.
